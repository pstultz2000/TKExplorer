## TKExplorer - A Simple Python-Based Browser
Created by Paul Stultz

---------------------------------

## Disclaimer: TKExplorer has minimal security features. It's designed to demonstrate the capabilities of Python 3.12.1 and existing libraries in creating a basic browser. It cannot run JavaScript and is intended for safe, well-established websites.

## Prerequisites
- Python installed as a Windows app. You can download it from the Microsoft Store (https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9PJPW5LDXLZ5).
- Required modules: TkHTMLview and BeautifulSoup4.
These can be installed with pip through the command prompt, here are the commands: 'pip install tkhtmlview' and 'pip install beautifulsoup4'.

## How to Run:
- On Windows, unzip the package and double-click 'launch.bat'. Compatible with versions of Windows that support Python 3.10.

## Features:
- Content that cannot be properly displayed is not loaded, thanks to BeautifulSoup4.
- Supports HTTPS via TkHTMLview, offering secure connections despite its simplicity.
- Graphical interface is a step above text browsers like Lynx.
- Back and Forward buttons for simple navigation.

## This project is a showcase of rapid development using Python and is not intended for practical web browsing.
